PROCEDURE: Consent was obtained. The areas were prepped and draped and localized in the usual manner. First attention was drawn to the left back. An elliptical incision was made with a 15-blade scalpel. The skin ellipse was then grasped with a Bishop forceps and curved Iris scissors were used to dissect the skin ellipse. After dissection, the skin was undermined. Radiofrequency cautery was used for hemostasis, and using a 5-0 undyed Vicryl skin was closed in the subcuticular plane and then skin was closed at the level of the skin with 4-0 nylon interrupted suture.

Next, attention was drawn to the mid back. The skin was incised with a vertical elliptical incision with a 15-blade scalpel and then the mass was grasped with a Bishop forceps and excised with curved Iris scissors. Afterwards, the skin was approximated using 4-0 nylon interrupted sutures. Next, attention was drawn to the shoulder lesion. It was previously marked and a 15-blade scalpel was used to make an elliptical incision into the skin.
