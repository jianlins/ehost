HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68-year-old woman whom I have been following, who has had angina. In any case today, she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent, three days ago, and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when I spoke to her. I advised her to call 911, which she did. While waiting for 911, she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain. By the time she presented here, she is currently pain-free and is feeling well.

PAST CARDIAC HISTORY: The patient has been having arm pain for several months. She underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me, which was equivocal, but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia. I had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy, so we put her on a beta-blocker. However, her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain, so she presented to the emergency room. On 08/16/08, she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80% mid LAD lesion, circumflex normal, and RCA totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right, as well as right to right to that area. The decision was made to transfer her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the LAD stenosis to the RCA vessel. She underwent that with drug-eluting stents on 08/16/08, with I believe three or four total placed, and was discharged on 08/17/08. She had some left arm discomfort on 08/18/08, but this was mild. Yesterday, she felt very fatigued, but no arm pain, and today, she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin. This is her usual angina. She is being admitted with unstable angina post stent.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Longstanding hypertension, CAD as above, hyperlipidemia, and overactive bladder.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Detrol LA 2 mg once a day.
2. Prilosec for GERD 20 mg once a day.
3. Glucosamine 500/400 mg once a day for arthritis.
